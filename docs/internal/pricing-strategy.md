# Lattice Pricing Strategy & Package Details

## Pricing Philosophy

Lattice pricing is designed around **value-based tiers** that align with startup growth stages and infrastructure complexity needs. Our pricing model focuses on:

1. **Predictable Monthly Costs**: No usage-based surprises
2. **Value-First Approach**: Price based on business value, not resource consumption
3. **Growth-Aligned Tiers**: Packages that scale with company maturity
4. **Consultation-Heavy Model**: We're partners, not just tool vendors

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Raw AWS CDK
- **Lattice**: Simple JSON → Production infrastructure
- **AWS CDK**: Complex TypeScript → Requires deep AWS expertise
- **Value**: 10x faster development, no DevOps expertise required

### vs. Terraform
- **Lattice**: Built-in best practices, automatic security
- **Terraform**: Declarative but requires infrastructure knowledge
- **Value**: Security and compliance by default, not afterthought

### vs. Pulumi
- **Lattice**: AI-friendly, startup-focused
- **Pulumi**: Multi-language but still exposes cloud complexity
- **Value**: Designed for AI code generation, startup growth patterns

### vs. AWS SAM/CloudFormation
- **Lattice**: High-level abstractions, built-in guardrails
- **AWS SAM**: Verbose, requires AWS expertise
- **Value**: 90% less code, automatic best practices

## Pricing Justification

### Starter Package ($299/month)

- DevOps Engineer Salary: $120k-180k/year ($10k-15k/month)
- AWS Consulting: $200-400/hour
- Security Audit: $15k-50k one-time
- **Lattice ROI**: 30-50x cost savings vs. hiring

**Value Delivered:**
- Eliminates need for DevOps hire for 12-18 months
- Production deployment in days vs. months
- Built-in security saves $15k-50k audit costs
- Cost optimization saves 30-50% on AWS bills

### Growth Package ($799/month)
**Cost Comparison:**
- Senior DevOps Engineer: $150k-200k/year ($12k-17k/month)
- Solutions Architect Consulting: $300-500/hour
- Multi-region setup: 3-6 months of engineering time
- **Lattice ROI**: 15-20x cost savings vs. hiring

- Enterprise consulting: $500k-2M implementation
- Compliance certification: $100k-500k
- **Lattice ROI**: 5-10x cost savings vs. internal team

## Sales Objection Handling

### "Why not just hire a DevOps engineer?"
- **Response**: "A DevOps engineer costs $120k-180k/year and takes 3-6 months to set up production infrastructure. Lattice gets you production-ready in your first week for $299/month. You can delay that DevOps hire by 12-18 months and focus your budget on product development."

### "We can use free tools like Terraform"
- **Response**: "Terraform is free, but the expertise isn't. You'll spend months learning AWS best practices, security configurations, and cost optimization. Lattice includes all of that knowledge built-in, plus ongoing support and optimization."

### "What about vendor lock-in?"
- **Response**: "Lattice generates standard AWS CDK code that you own. You can always export your infrastructure and manage it directly. We're not locking you in - we're giving you a head start with best practices."

### "Our needs are too unique"
- **Response**: "That's exactly why we have escape hatches and custom modules. Our Growth and Enterprise packages include custom solutions for unique requirements. We've never met a use case we couldn't handle."

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Customer Success Metrics
- **Time to Production**: Target <7 days (vs. industry average 3-6 months)

- Industry-specific packages (FinTech, HealthTech, etc.)
- Compliance-specific tiers (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- Partner channel pricing

## Competitive Response Strategy

### If competitors lower prices:
- Emphasize value and outcomes, not price
- Highlight consultation and support differentiators
- Focus on total cost of ownership (TCO)

### If competitors add similar features:
- Accelerate innovation in AI-friendly architecture
- Deepen startup-specific optimizations
- Strengthen consultation and support moat

### If AWS launches competing service:
- Position as AWS-native solution (built on CDK)
- Emphasize startup focus vs. enterprise focus
- Leverage existing customer relationships and success stories
