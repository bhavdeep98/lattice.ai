## Slide 2: The Problem
**Startups Face an Infrastructure Dilemma**

❌ **Option 1: DIY Infrastructure**
- 3-6 months to production
- Requires expensive DevOps expertise
- Security vulnerabilities
- Cost overruns

❌ **Option 2: Hire DevOps Engineer**
- $120k-180k/year salary
- 3-6 months to find and onboard
- Still takes months to set up
- Single point of failure

❌ **Option 3: Use Raw AWS Tools**
- Steep learning curve
- Complex configurations
- Easy to make costly mistakes
- No built-in best practices

## Slide 3: The Cost of Delay
**Every Month Without Production Infrastructure Costs You:**

💰 **Revenue Loss**: $50k-200k in delayed customer acquisition
⏰ **Engineering Time**: 40-60% of dev team focused on infrastructure
🔒 **Security Risk**: Vulnerable to breaches and compliance failures
📈 **Scaling Issues**: Technical debt that compounds over time

*"We spent 4 months building infrastructure instead of features. Our competitors launched first."* - Anonymous Startup CTO
