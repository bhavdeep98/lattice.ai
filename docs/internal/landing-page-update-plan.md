# Landing Page Update Plan & Implementation

## Issues Identified

### 1. Outdated Feature Claims
- **Problem**: Website mentioned "ML modules" and "Events" that don't exist yet
- **Fix**: Updated to reflect actual implemented modules (Network, Storage, Database, Identity, Compute, Queue, Website)

### 2. Missing Key Features
- **Problem**: New features like cross-account deployment, automated threat modeling, and comprehensive observability weren't highlighted
- **Fix**: Added prominent sections for these differentiating capabilities

### 3. Inconsistent Messaging
- **Problem**: Hero section was too generic and didn't clearly communicate value
- **Fix**: Focused on concrete benefits: "7 days to production" instead of vague "10x faster"

### 4. Pricing Alignment
- **Problem**: Website pricing matched internal strategy but lacked clear value justification
- **Fix**: Enhanced feature descriptions and added ROI-focused FAQ

## Changes Implemented

### Hero Section Updates
- **Before**: "Your next breakthrough, powered by Infrastructure AI"
- **After**: "Production AWS Infrastructure in days, not months"
- **Rationale**: More concrete and specific value proposition

### Statistics Updates
- **Before**: "10x faster deployment", "90% cost reduction", "100% security compliance"
- **After**: "7 days to production", "15 months DevOps hiring delay", "30-50% AWS cost savings"
- **Rationale**: Specific, measurable claims based on actual customer outcomes

### Feature Highlights
- **Added**: Automated Threat Modeling, Comprehensive Monitoring, Cross-Account Deployment
- **Removed**: Generic "Sustainability" and "Observability" 
- **Rationale**: Focus on unique, implemented capabilities that differentiate from competitors

### Pricing Section Enhancements
- **Starter Package**: Clarified "5 core modules" instead of vague "all core modules"
- **Growth Package**: Added "Role-based dashboards" and "Advanced queue & website modules"
- **FAQ**: Added DevOps hiring cost comparison for clear ROI justification
